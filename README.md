# NY Citi Bike - draft
## Overview
The objective of this project was to provide information about bicycle utilization patterns of NY Citi Bike customers for a client. The client is thinking of starting her own bicycle ride sharing business in Des Moines, IA. An analysis of data from August of 2019 was  specifically requested. The client will use this information to broker a strategic conversation with investors. 
## Data Retrieval
The data that was used for this project was retrieved from Citi Bike Trip Histories, specific to August of 2019.  A Pandaâ€™s data frame was utilized to create an additional csv  data file that included a formatted date and time field for the trip duration. Both data sets were used to create the Tableau visualizations in this project.
